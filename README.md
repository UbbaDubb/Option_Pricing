# OptionPricing

A C++ project focused on pricing financial options, developed to reinforce concepts from online courses in C++ and Advanced Calculus in Financial Engineering.

This project focuses on:

Designing a clean, object-oriented architecture with abstract base classes and specialized option types

Applying mathematical models for pricing options and calculating Greeks

Gaining hands-on experience with CMake, Visual Studio, and Git

The goal is to deepen understanding of both object-oriented programming and financial engineering principles through practical implementation of option pricing models.
